simpleNMR MNOVA Installation
============================

Introduction
------------

The simpleNMR suite of tools are now embedded in MNOVA. This decision
was made because Durham University, where the software was developed,
has a site license for MNOVA and it is the software of choice for the
students to process their NMR data.

In this instruction note we show how to install the simpleNMR tools in
MNOVA. With the help of Mestrelab Research, we have simplified the
process as much as possible.

Setting up simpleNMR in MNOVA
-----------------------------

All the simpleNMR qs scripts that run in MNOVA are in the folder
MNOVAscripts. This folder can be stored anywhere on your computer, or,
as we have done at Durham University, they can be stored on a shared
drive where all the students can access them and they can be updated
easily.

For example, if the MNOVAscripts are installed at

Y:\\downloads\\Eric\\MNOVAscripts

Do the following:

-  Open the MNOVA software and click on the cog icon in the right-hand
   corner of the toolbar
