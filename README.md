# simpleNMRtools
set of tools to help analyse small molecule NMR data to aid structure validation/elucidation

Getting this to run locally is aquite hard as one needs to have a java runtime and compile the java scripts for running the c13 nmrshiftdb HOSE code.

My reccommendation would be to try the simpleNMR version hosted at [simpleNMR](https://simplenmr.pythonanywhere.com/). At the home page one can download the MNOVA QtScripts
and there are instructions to install them in the documentation that can be found at the home page.

If you still prefer to run the simpleNMR server locally, get in touch via email simpleNMR@gmail.com and I will attempt to help you if you run into problems.

I will attempt to add instructions on the this page to help users in the near future
